<h1>cmpctircd</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>The aim of this project is to provide a stable, fast, and <em>modern</em> ircd.</p>
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>For now, it is still under heavy development. It will be clear when it is production ready. 
<a href="https://bugs.cmpct.info/">Bugzilla</a> is a good indicator of progress.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>Email me at sam@cmpct.info if you wish to contribute or you have questions.
An IRC server will be created once <em>cmpctircd</em> is ready to self-host - <strong>soon</strong>.</p>
